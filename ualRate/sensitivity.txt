We can use this file for random notes about the sensitivity testing
using the pensPlan.py model and its friends.

Variables that might impact the UAL growth rate (which appears to be
pensPlan.growthRate).

pensPlan.discountRate (is this reflected in pensPop.discountRate?)

pensFund.volatility -- this actually contains both mean returns for
                    the different asset classes and volatility.  The
                    variable that will be of interest is the actual
                    average returns and sd of the entire portfolio.

pensMember.cola

pensPlan.employmentGrowth

pensMember.pension (proxy for benefit generosity, so mostly refers to
                    the factor 0.55 that is there)

pensMember.projectSalaryDelta

Plan demographics will potentially be interesting. We might add a
fudge factor to pensMort to slightly goose mortality rates up and
down.


We do not have contributions as an independent variable, but tracking
the growth rate of contributions (premiums) will be useful.  Do we
already have that through the contribution rate?
